  "content": "Late evening in the Mac lab.\n\nEveryone else had gone home hours ago. I was staring at my screen, trying to figure out how to make a computer understand poetry.\n\nNot just read it. *Understand* it.\n\nThe kind of understanding where a student could ask, what this story about ? at 2 AM and get an answer that actually helped. Not a Wikipedia summary. Not a generic chatbot response. Something that felt like talking to a teacher who'd read the book a hundred times.\n\nThat's what I was building. An AI tutor named Shalini, designed to help students explore their English textbook, a collection called Kaleidoscope, full of poems, short stories, dramas, and science fiction.\n\nThe problem was simple to state, hard to solve.\n\n---\n\nYou can't just throw an entire book at an AI and expect magic.\n\nI tried. It didn't work.\n\nThink about it this way. If I asked you about a specific scene from a 500-page novel you read months ago, you wouldn't reread the whole thing. You'd flip to the relevant chapter. Find the scene. Use that context to answer.\n\nThat's what the AI needed to do.\n\nThe technique is called Retrieval Augmented Generation. RAG. Fancy name for a simple idea: don't make the AI remember everything. Make it look things up.\n\n---\n\nFirst challenge: breaking the textbook into pieces.\n\nLike creating an index card system for your brain.\n\nI divided the book into paragraphs. Roughly 300 words each. Not too big to overwhelm. Not too small to lose context.\n\nHere's the trick that took me a while to figure out. Each chunk overlaps with the previous one by 100 words. Because meaning doesn't stop at paragraph boundaries. If a character is introduced at the end of one section and discussed in the next, the overlap keeps that connection alive.\n\nThen I extracted the important stuff using natural language processing. Names. Places. Organizations. If a paragraph mentions Captain Hagberd or Colebrook from Tomorrow, those become searchable. Page numbers and author names get preserved too, so Shalini can tell students exactly where to find things in their physical book.\n\n---\n\nNow the really interesting part.\n\nComputers don't understand words. They need numbers.\n\nSo I used something called an embedding model, specifically 'all-roberta-large-v1' from HuggingFace. Think of it as a translator that converts each paragraph into a list of 1,024 numbers. A vector.\n\nBut these aren't random numbers.\n\nParagraphs with similar *meanings* get similar vectors. So if one section talks about love and sacrifice and another discusses devotion and selflessness, they end up close together in this 1,024-dimensional space. Even if they use completely different words.\n\nIt's like creating a map where similar ideas cluster together.\n\nI remember the moment this clicked for me. Running a test query and watching the system pull up exactly the right passage from a chapter I'd almost forgotten about. Not because the words matched. Because the *meaning* matched.\n\n---\n\nAll these numbered paragraphs needed a home.\n\nA special database called Qdrant, designed for exactly this kind of search. Unlike normal databases that look for exact matches, Qdrant finds the *closest* matches.\n\nWhen a student asks \"What motivated Captain Hagberd?\", the system converts that question into a vector. Searches for paragraphs with similar vectors. Retrieves the top two most relevant chunks. Sends those as context to the AI.\n\nFor poems, I used something different. A TreeIndex from LlamaIndex. Poetry has unique structure and flow. It benefits from hierarchical organization.\n\n---\n\nThe actual thinking happens with Llama-3.3-70b-versatile, a large language model from Groq. Good at creative, nuanced responses. Perfect for literature discussions.\n\nBut I don't just let the AI ramble.\n\nUsing LangChain, I orchestrate everything. System prompts define Shalini's personality, helpful, encouraging, knowledgeable. Guardrails keep responses focused on literature education. Context integration weaves the retrieved paragraphs into coherent answers. Conversation memory means Shalini remembers what you discussed earlier.\n\n---\n\nThe interface is built with Gradio, deployed on HuggingFace.\n\nEach user gets their own conversation history. Previous messages display so you can follow the thread. A dropdown lets you focus on specific chapters. You can download chapters for reference.\n\nAsk a question, get a thoughtful answer. Follow up naturally. \"Can you explain that differently?\" or \"Tell me more about that character.\" Shalini provides page references so you can verify in your textbook.\n\n---\n\nFor the curious minds, here's what powers it all.\n\nLlamaIndex for building and querying knowledge indices. LangChain for orchestration, prompts, and guardrails. Qdrant for semantic search. Gradio for the interface. HuggingFace for deployment. Groq for fast inference. NLTK for entity extraction. Python tying it together.\n\n---\n\nBuilding this taught me things I didn't expect.\n\nChunking matters more than I thought. How you break down knowledge dramatically affects what you get back. The 300-word chunks with 100-word overlap turned out to be the sweet spot. Took several failed attempts to find it.\n\nMetadata is gold. Extracting entities and page numbers made responses precise and verifiable.\n\nContext is everything. RAG outperforms pure language models because it grounds responses in actual content. The AI isn't making things up. It's working from the source.\n\nAnd user experience matters. Technical sophistication means nothing if students don't find it easy to use. I spent more time on the interface than I expected. Worth every hour.\n\n---\n\nThere's more I want to add someday. Multi-lingual support. Quiz generation. Visual analysis for illustrated pages. Study plans based on exam syllabus. Integration with note-taking apps.\n\nBut that's for later.\n\n---\n\nLate nights in the Mac lab, building something that might help a student understand a poem at 2 AM.\n\nThat's the part I'll remember.\n\nNot the embedding dimensions or the chunk sizes. The feeling of watching it work for the first time. A question going in, the right answer coming out, grounded in the actual textbook.\n\nLearning shouldn't feel like pulling teeth.\n\nIt should feel like talking to someone who genuinely wants to help you understand.\n\nThat's what Shalini is. An AI tutor who knows the book. Remembers your conversation. Points you to the page.\n\nA teacher who never sleeps.",
